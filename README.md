## üéµ Overview

This project focuses on **music genre classification** using the well-known **GTZAN Dataset**. It involves extracting and analyzing audio features from music clips and applying machine learning models to classify them into genres.

## üß† How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the dataset CSV file is available locally.
3. Open the code notebook or script.
4. **Below the `preprocess()` function**, locate the `# Load datasets` comment.
5. Replace the dataset path(s) with the correct path on your local machine.

```python
# Example:
data = pd.read_csv("your/local/path/to/dataset.csv")
```

6. Run each block of code **sequentially** for correct execution.
